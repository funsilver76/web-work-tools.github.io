<p>Google comes up with keywords, based on your seed keywords. Ideally you want google to come up with a lot of them. We'll get to that later.</p>
<p>Go to the top right corner and download the keywords and keyword planner will give you a csv file that we're going to open up in a spreadsheet program.</p>

<p>You can see that there are a lot of ways to explore this data, I'm going to sort it by volume.</p>
<p>Then I can cut out all of the keywords that are really high volume or by whatever metrics I'm looking at, and use the keywords I get from keyword planner with a number of other tools.</p>
