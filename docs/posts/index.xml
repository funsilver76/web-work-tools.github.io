Because you can edit your DNS records, you can use them to always point to the latest version of an object in IPFS (remember that an IPFS object’s address changes if you modify the object).</description>

&lt;p&gt;The bottom of every page in the theme can optionally show a short biography of the site author, including a profile picture, email link, and location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description> Since I changed the theme too quickly for anyone to really see what it looked like, I&amp;rsquo;ve been saving images of how it used to look.
The whole point was not to just have the same theme, but to be able to try out many Hugo themes&amp;hellip;
Though I really did like the HPSTR theme, I might switch back to the jekyll version even :)

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn Hugo a few different ways, and finally found one that works for me, and I hope will work well for anyone.
This guide and the accompanying repository should help anyone switching from either Jekyll to Hugo, or Hugo to Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got two branches of the same exact website except one is run by Jekyll and one is run by Hugo!!
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat, if you ask me!</description>

      <description>I made a test branch for the swapping jekyll for hugo article, and then merged the changes back to master, once I had it running.
Checkout test branch Use the command git checkout -b will allow you to create a local branch for testing.
I will call my new branch test-hugo so the command will be like so:
git checkout -b test-hugo
Some git basics for newbs like me  Git Branching and Merging  Git keeps track of all your files, but not just the files, but everything in the repository.</description>

      <description>I learned of this cool project from @bmann. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a simple way to make a page like this for a while!
It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to have a place to keep track, because I&amp;rsquo;m always forgetting how many I even manage!
It might seem intimidating to hear, &amp;ldquo;Just Fork It!&amp;rdquo;
However, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s not much more complex than that.
Step 1 Fork this repository:

      <description>Note: This is just a &amp;ldquo;stub&amp;rdquo;, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t go fully into the details of keyword research. I have written an article on the subject, and begun some study of Keyword Research and SEO, although I&amp;rsquo;m not by any means an expert.
I made this, because it was a little confusing for me when I first tried to use it, and I wanted to be sure that eveyone in my organization had a fundamental understanding of keyword research, so they could assist in coming up with seed-keywords, and understand the building blocks of keyword-research.</description>

      <description>Devopedia.org   Well, now i&amp;rsquo;m looking into options besides jekyll, to expand my skills, and try out some themes that aren&amp;rsquo;t available for Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, if you are new like me, getting jekyll themes to work is tricky. Many of them are not supported anymore.
What is a Static Site Generator (SSG)? There are some configuration files, layouts and templates, and then there is all your content that your create.</description>

      <description>Shows what can be done in a short period of time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start building any of this till the beginning of this year.
It&amp;rsquo;s true that it&amp;rsquo;s a ton of work to do what I do, but you could use this concept for just one topic instead of 100 and build a valuable resource in a few days!
I will publish monthly stats, though it won&amp;rsquo;t always be the same, and if you have any requests, pop up in the issues.</description>

This is indigo, an Indieweb prepared Hugo theme, that I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about more soon, and figuring out how to make use of all its awesome indieweb integrations.

      <description>Github makes it easy to get started, with the click of a button, you can have a web-page live, requiring only markdown skills (that anyone can learn on the go).
Each feature you want to enable requires a little more learning, and GitHub Pages is set up so that if you decide to, you can gradually progress from content creator to web-developer.
If you don’t want to think about web-development, and simply want your markdown files to look beautiful once published, github pages can help you do that too.</description>

      <description>SEO seems like a valuable subject to know about right?
The problem with SEO is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn, it&amp;rsquo;s a vast domain of knowledge, with many branches that could each take up thier own websites of related information.
SEO is always changing, and a lot of incorrect or outdated information is republished.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do is break it down into it&amp;rsquo;s various components.
The fundamental building blocks of SEO are:</description>
