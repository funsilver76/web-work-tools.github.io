      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-from-the-editor&#34;&gt;Notes from the Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that the repository hasn&amp;rsquo;t been recently updated by it&amp;rsquo;s owner, however, I can find some helpful contributions from the community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/pulls&#34;&gt;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/pulls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*note, I changed the date so it would bump to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;indigo-authors&#34;&gt;Indigo Authors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom of every page in the theme can optionally show a short biography of the site author, including a profile picture, email link, and location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s personal. It&amp;rsquo;s private. And it&amp;rsquo;s no one&amp;rsquo;s business but yours. You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your taxes, or having a secret romance. Or you may be communicating with a political dissident in a repressive country. Whatever it is, you don&amp;rsquo;t want your private electronic mail (email) or confidential documents read by anyone else. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with asserting your privacy. Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.</description>
