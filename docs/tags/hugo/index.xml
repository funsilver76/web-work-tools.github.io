      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-from-the-editor&#34;&gt;Notes from the Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that the repository hasn&amp;rsquo;t been recently updated by it&amp;rsquo;s owner, however, I can find some helpful contributions from the community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/pulls&#34;&gt;https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/pulls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*note, I changed the date so it would bump to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;indigo-authors&#34;&gt;Indigo Authors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom of every page in the theme can optionally show a short biography of the site author, including a profile picture, email link, and location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jekyll HPSTR-Theme Blog Index Demo</title>

      <description> Since I changed the theme too quickly for anyone to really see what it looked like, I&amp;rsquo;ve been saving images of how it used to look.
The whole point was not to just have the same theme, but to be able to try out many Hugo themes&amp;hellip;
Though I really did like the HPSTR theme, I might switch back to the jekyll version even :)

      <title>Migrating from Jekyll HPSTR to Hugo.</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn Hugo a few different ways, and finally found one that works for me, and I hope will work well for anyone.
This guide and the accompanying repository should help anyone switching from either Jekyll to Hugo, or Hugo to Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got two branches of the same exact website except one is run by Jekyll and one is run by Hugo!!
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat, if you ask me!</description>

      <title>Creating a Test Branch and Merging back the Changes</title>

      <description>I made a test branch for the swapping jekyll for hugo article, and then merged the changes back to master, once I had it running.
Checkout test branch Use the command git checkout -b will allow you to create a local branch for testing.
I will call my new branch test-hugo so the command will be like so:
git checkout -b test-hugo
Some git basics for newbs like me  Git Branching and Merging  Git keeps track of all your files, but not just the files, but everything in the repository.</description>
