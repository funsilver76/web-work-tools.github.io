      <description>Note: This is just a &amp;ldquo;stub&amp;rdquo;, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t go fully into the details of keyword research. I have written an article on the subject, and begun some study of Keyword Research and SEO, although I&amp;rsquo;m not by any means an expert.
I made this, because it was a little confusing for me when I first tried to use it, and I wanted to be sure that eveyone in my organization had a fundamental understanding of keyword research, so they could assist in coming up with seed-keywords, and understand the building blocks of keyword-research.</description>
