      <description>I learned of this cool project from @bmann. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a simple way to make a page like this for a while!
It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to have a place to keep track, because I&amp;rsquo;m always forgetting how many I even manage!
It might seem intimidating to hear, &amp;ldquo;Just Fork It!&amp;rdquo;
However, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s not much more complex than that.
Step 1 Fork this repository:
 github/personal-website  Step 2 Go to settings and select publish from master branch:</description>

      <description>Shows what can be done in a short period of time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start building any of this till the beginning of this year.
It&amp;rsquo;s true that it&amp;rsquo;s a ton of work to do what I do, but you could use this concept for just one topic instead of 100 and build a valuable resource in a few days!
I will publish monthly stats, though it won&amp;rsquo;t always be the same, and if you have any requests, pop up in the issues.</description>

I was using miklb/jekyll-indieweb, but ran into some bugs and found that a new release is coming soon:

This is indigo, an Indieweb prepared Hugo theme, that I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about more soon, and figuring out how to make use of all its awesome indieweb integrations.
I cover most anything you&amp;rsquo;d need to get started with GitHub Pages in:

      <description>Github makes it easy to get started, with the click of a button, you can have a web-page live, requiring only markdown skills (that anyone can learn on the go).
Each feature you want to enable requires a little more learning, and GitHub Pages is set up so that if you decide to, you can gradually progress from content creator to web-developer.
If you don’t want to think about web-development, and simply want your markdown files to look beautiful once published, github pages can help you do that too.</description>

      <description>Continued from Github Pages Starter Pack.  Setup Front Matter  Front Matter YAML front matter in Jekyll YAML tutorial in the context of Jekyll  Layouts Layouts are preconfigured page templates. When I started, it was too much to think about layouts, and I would use &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo;. Now that I am using blog posts.. (because they populate your RSS feed, and increases their portability) I&amp;rsquo;m also using the Home layout:</description>
