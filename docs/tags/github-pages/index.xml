      <description>I learned of this cool project from @bmann. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a simple way to make a page like this for a while!
It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to have a place to keep track, because I&amp;rsquo;m always forgetting how many I even manage!
It might seem intimidating to hear, &amp;ldquo;Just Fork It!&amp;rdquo;
However, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s not much more complex than that.
Step 1 Fork this repository:
 github/personal-website  Step 2 Go to settings and select publish from master branch:</description>

      <description>Pro-tip: Go Home for a full view of featured image.
 Shows what can be done in a short period of time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start building any of this till the beginning of this year.
It&amp;rsquo;s true that it&amp;rsquo;s a ton of work to do what I do, but you could use this concept for just one topic instead of 100 and build a valuable resource in a few days!</description>

      <title>GitHub Pages-Starter Pack</title>

      <description>Github makes it easy to get started, with the click of a button, you can have a web-page live, requiring only markdown skills (that anyone can learn on the go).
Each feature you want to enable requires a little more learning, and GitHub Pages is set up so that if you decide to, you can gradually progress from content creator to web-developer.
If you donâ€™t want to think about web-development, and simply want your markdown files to look beautiful once published, github pages can help you do that too.</description>
