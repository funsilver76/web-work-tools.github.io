      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some tools to make content creation a little easier.

      <description>You may have noticed that the GitHub Pages Starter Pack is getting a bit crowded.
Well, now i&amp;rsquo;m looking into options besides jekyll, to expand my skills, and try out some themes that aren&amp;rsquo;t available for Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, if you are new like me, getting jekyll themes to work is tricky. Many of them are not supported anymore.
What is a Static Site Generator (SSG)? There are some configuration files, layouts and templates, and then there is all your content that your create.</description>

I was using miklb/jekyll-indieweb, but ran into some bugs and found that a new release is coming soon:

In the meantime, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d test out this awesome projects-pages theme.
I&amp;rsquo;m only guessing that some indieweb folk might appreciate:
 Project-Pages also includes advanced layouts for the coding scientist. MATLAB and Jupyter layouts provide a framework for direct to post functionality. Surface and Projector layouts provide 3D visualization methods.</description>

      <title>GitHub Pages-Starter Pack</title>
      <link>https://infominer.id/web-work/posts/github-pages-starter-pack/</link>

      <description>Github makes it easy to get started, with the click of a button, you can have a web-page live, requiring only markdown skills (that anyone can learn on the go).
Each feature you want to enable requires a little more learning, and GitHub Pages is set up so that if you decide to, you can gradually progress from content creator to web-developer.
If you don’t want to think about web-development, and simply want your markdown files to look beautiful once published, github pages can help you do that too.</description>

      <description>SEO seems like a valuable subject to know about right?
The problem with SEO is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn, it&amp;rsquo;s a vast domain of knowledge, with many branches that could each take up thier own websites of related information.
SEO is always changing, and a lot of incorrect or outdated information is republished.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do is break it down into it&amp;rsquo;s various components.
The fundamental building blocks of SEO are:</description>
