I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, if you are new like me, getting jekyll themes to work is tricky. Many of them are not supported anymore.
What is a Static Site Generator (SSG)? There are some configuration files, layouts and templates, and then there is all your content that your create.</description>

I was using miklb/jekyll-indieweb, but ran into some bugs and found that a new release is coming soon:

This is indigo, an Indieweb prepared Hugo theme, that I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about more soon, and figuring out how to make use of all its awesome indieweb integrations.

      <description>Github makes it easy to get started, with the click of a button, you can have a web-page live, requiring only markdown skills (that anyone can learn on the go).
Each feature you want to enable requires a little more learning, and GitHub Pages is set up so that if you decide to, you can gradually progress from content creator to web-developer.
If you don’t want to think about web-development, and simply want your markdown files to look beautiful once published, github pages can help you do that too.</description>

Setup Front Matter  Front Matter YAML front matter in Jekyll YAML tutorial in the context of Jekyll  Layouts Layouts are preconfigured page templates. When I started, it was too much to think about layouts, and I would use &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;page&amp;rdquo;. Now that I am using blog posts..

      <description>SEO seems like a valuable subject to know about right?
The problem with SEO is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn, it&amp;rsquo;s a vast domain of knowledge, with many branches that could each take up thier own websites of related information.
SEO is always changing, and a lot of incorrect or outdated information is republished.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do is break it down into it&amp;rsquo;s various components.
