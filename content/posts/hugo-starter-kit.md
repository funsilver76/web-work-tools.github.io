### Academic

If you are somewhat familiar with Jekyll already, I'll recommend jumping right in with Academic Pages.

I tried [github.com/search?q=hugo+theme](https://github.com/search?q=hugo+theme), and found that Academic has a toooon of stars. More even than the repository for all of hugos themes in one place !!!

There is a one click fork\deploy with GitHub\GitLab Pages and Netlify.

Seriously just click a button, it creates the repo and publishes it for you. Then just dive in like I am:
