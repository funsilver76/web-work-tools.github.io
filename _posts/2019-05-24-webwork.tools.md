This blog is where I document my journey as an independent web-worker, and will grow to include contributions from other independent workers of the web.

This page has some samples of content that I've created for others, as well as general resources for web-work.

Originally it wasn't in blog form... but I just looked on github, to see when I started, and chose the date that way, for each. This page wasn't in the blog, either.. but seems like it was hidden away in the menu, and less accessible.
