## Using different versions of Hugo:

* [Netlify Plus Hugo .20 and beyond](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/04/11/netlify-plus-hugo-0.20-and-beyond/)
  >Until yesterday, if you wanted to use a new version of Hugo on Netlify, you had two options. The first one was to wait for us to install it on our build servers and work around name collisions. Although it was not complicated, you can see by reading this blog post, it’s not very sustainable. The second option was to add the version of the Hugo binary you wanted to use to your repository. Since Hugo is a static binary, this is a very convenient solution if you want to manage it yourself.
  >
  >Starting today, if you want to use a specific new version of Hugo on Netlify, you only need to set the environment variable HUGO_VERSION with the version number you want to use. If it’s a valid release number, we’ll install it for you and use that version. You don’t have to wait for us, or manage binaries yourself. For example, if you want to use Hugo 0.20 right now, you can go to your site’s settings (Build and Deploy, Build Environment Variables section) and set HUGO_VERSION to 0.20 in your environment.

Basically, if you use netlify it will build with whatever version you tell it to. Otherwise you need to install specific versions locally. You can just drop the binary of the version you need in the root of that projects repository.

### Academic

If you are somewhat familiar with Jekyll already, you may want to jumping right in with Academic Pages. It's not exactly simple, but its versatile.

I tried [github.com/search?q=hugo+theme](https://github.com/search?q=hugo+theme), and found that Academic has a toooon of stars. More even than the repository for all of hugos themes in one place !!!

There is a one click fork\deploy with GitHub\GitLab Pages and Netlify.

Seriously just click a button, it creates the repo and publishes it for you. 

* [Academic Install](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/)
  >You can choose from one of the following four methods to install:
    >- one-click install using your web browser (recommended)
    >- install on your computer using Git with the Command Prompt/Terminal app
    >- install on your computer by downloading the ZIP files
    >- install on your computer with RStudio

### Learn

Another documentation theme, I think a bit simpler than Academic.
