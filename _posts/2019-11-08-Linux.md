[How to create sudo user on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver Linux - Linu...](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-create-sudo-user-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux)

I was having a bit of trouble understanding how to properly set up and operate a user alongside and admin acct

I guess the idea is that the administrator account is the first created automatically (in ubuntu) then create a user account. Although the default administrator requires password for sudo, since 'root' is actually abstracted from the ui. Though not actually root, that administrator does, have generally elevated privs otherwise. So by making a user account, you have an additional layer of security, should some application get loose, it doesn't inherit any administrator privliges from you (edited)

but......... to use sudo from the user account (edited)

you must either su administrator or add the user account to your list of sudoers

[https://askubuntu.com/a/296270](https://askubuntu.com/a/296270)

If you want to add another user or if your username did not install Ubuntu, then you must log in as that user who installed Ubuntu, enter sudo -i to get root prompt; and then enter this command visudo.

I usually add the users I want to have sudo access. You can also add a group to have sudo access. I prefer just adding the users. I added a space in between the following, so it would format better.

# User_Alias ADMINS = jsmith, mikem

dbadmin ALL=(ALL) ALL

[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview)

/bin is a place for most commonly used terminal commands, like ls, mount, rm, etc.
/boot contains files needed to start up the system, including the Linux kernel, a RAM disk image and bootloader configuration files. 
/dev contains all device files, which are not regular files but instead refer to various hardware devices on the system, including hard drives.
/etc contains system-global configuration files, which affect the system's behavior for all users.
/home home sweet home, this is the place for users' home directories.
/lib contains very important dynamic libraries and kernel modules /media is intended as a mount point for external devices, such as hard drives or removable media (floppies, CDs, DVDs). 
/mnt is also a place for mount points, but dedicated specifically to "temporarily mounted" devices, such as network filesystems.
/opt can be used to store additional software for your system, which is not handled by the package manager.
/proc is a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism for kernel to send information to processes. 
/root is the superuser's home directory, not in /home/ to allow for booting the system even if /home/ is not available.
/run is a tmpfs (temporary file system) available early in the boot process where ephemeral run-time data is stored. Files under this directory are removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process. (It deprecates various legacy locations such as /var/run, /var/lock, /lib/init/rw in otherwise non-ephemeral directory trees as well as /dev/.* and /dev/shm which are not device files.)
/sbin contains important administrative commands that should generally only be employed by the superuser.
/srv can contain data directories of services such as HTTP (/srv/www/) or FTP.
/sys is a virtual filesystem that can be accessed to set or obtain information about the kernel's view of the system.
/tmp is a place for temporary files used by applications.
/usr contains the majority of user utilities and applications, and partly replicates the root directory structure, containing for instance, among others, /usr/bin/ and /usr/lib.
/var is dedicated to variable data, such as logs, databases, websites, and temporary spool (e-mail etc.) files that persist from one boot to the next. A notable directory it contains is /var/log where system log files are kept.

**BASH - Shell Scripting** * [https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/intro_01.html](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/intro_01.html) 
>This is a practical guide which, while not always being too serious, tries to give real-life instead of theoretical examples. I partly wrote it because I don't get excited with stripped down and over-simplified examples written by people who know what they are talking about, showing some really cool Bash feature so much out of its context that you cannot ever use it in practical circumstances. You can read that sort of stuff after finishing this book, which contains exercises and examples that will help you survive in the real world.
