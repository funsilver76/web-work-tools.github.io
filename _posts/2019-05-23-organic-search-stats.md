Shows what can be done in a short period of time.  I didn't start building any of this till the beginning of this year. 

It's true that it's a ton of work to do what *I* do, but you could use this concept for just one topic instead of 100 and build a valuable resource in a few days!

<div class="pull-left"><img src="https://infominer.id/web-work/images/infolytics/record-monthly.png"/></div>

For now, I think the best way to use PDF on the web is to turn it to images. To get a high-quality image, I used [convert-my-image.com/](http://convert-my-image.com/), but I put [performance1.csv](https://infominer.id/web-work/_data/performance1.csv) and [performance2.csv](https://infominer.id/web-work/_data/performance1.csv) into the _data directory.

From there, jekyll throws it all up into `site.data.performance1` and `site.data.performance2` so I can call it with a bit of code and generate pages with it.  (eventually)

*pull requests welcome* ;)
