If you are confused about the value that can come from a JAMStack site, that is because JAMStack is one of the most poorly explained concepts on the web, specifically describing what problem it solves and what solutions it replaces. The purpose of JAMstack is essentially to create the same sort of website Drupal or Wordpress would build for you, but outsource the back-end functionality as much as possible, especially for static-sites, so that developers are focused on front end. This is done by using Javascript to define the front end behaviour, APIs to provide functionality to back-end hosted services, and Markup, which defines formatting. The rest of the stack can be outsourced to external infrastructure, whether it is CDNs for content delivery, back-end-as-service support like Firebase, and CMS used to define content like Contentful. Essentially, all you are left with is text files in a static respository like Github Pages, which is the basis for the site. No webserver is even required because the CDN serves the pages based on what is built from the Github Pages. This results in a significantly reduced attack surface and a super fast website loading time that doesn't rely on a central server for uptime.

  > The JAM part of JAMstack is an acronym of the three core concepts that are the heart of the stack: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. But we need to dig a little bit deeper to find out what the JAMstack is capable of, and how we can use these technologies together to enable great experiences.
