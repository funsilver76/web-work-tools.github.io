I've found myself repeating, and having a hard time remembering all of the steps when setting up ubuntu. Over the past 3 years, I started with Mint, as a daily driver, and have moved on to Ubuntu 19.04, and 18.04 LTS.

This is now where I'll be keeping track of this info. Over time, I'll organize this better, and add some notes for context, and mean to walk through the first steps of a few different setups.


At the moment, this is just a loosely organized collection of links I found useful, and leads for further exploration.

## Gnu

* [Linux and the GNU System](https://hackernoon.com/linux-and-the-gnu-system-fem53q09)
  > Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users arenot aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
* [The GNU Manifesto - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html)
  > I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it. Software sellers want to divide the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with others. I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way. I cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement. For years I worked within the Artificial Intelligence Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually they had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such things are done for me against my will.
  > 
  > So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to get along without any software that is not free. I have resigned from the AI Lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent me from giving GNU away.(2)
* [Overview of the GNU System - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html)
  > The word “free” in “free software” pertains to freedom, not price. You may or may not pay a price to get GNU software. Either way, once you have the software you have four specific freedoms in using it. The freedom to run the program as you wish; the freedom to copy the program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; the freedom to change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code; the freedom to distribute an improved version and thus help build the community. (If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, or you may give away copies.)
  > 
  > The project to develop the GNU system is called the “GNU Project”. The GNU Project was conceived in 1983 as a way of bringing back the cooperative spirit that prevailed in the computing community in earlier days—to make cooperation possible once again by removing the obstacles to cooperation imposed by the owners of proprietary software.
* [What's in a Name?](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html)
  > A great challenge to the future of free software comes from the tendency of the “Linux” distribution companies to add nonfree software to GNU/Linux in the name of convenience and power. All the major commercial distribution developers do this; none limits itself to free software. Most of them do not clearly identify the nonfree packages in their distributions. Many even develop nonfree software and add it to the system. Some outrageously advertise “Linux” systems that are “licensed per seat”, which give the user as much freedom as Microsoft Windows.
  > 
  > People try to justify adding nonfree software in the name of the “popularity of Linux”—in effect, valuing popularity above freedom. Sometimes this is openly admitted. For instance, Wired Magazine said that Robert McMillan, editor of Linux Magazine, “feels that the move toward open source software should be fueled by technical, rather than political, decisions.” And Caldera's CEO openly urged users to drop the goal of freedom and work instead for the “popularity of Linux”.

## Setup

### Boot Loaders and Partition Tables

Basically all new systems use UEFI. However, if you are shopping for old laptops, or simply installing linux on some old windows machine you have laying around, then you might run into the legacy setup. The deal is how they are partitioned, MBR vs GPT, and can depend upon your BIOS. So it matters to figure out from the beginning what your system requirements are.

Actually, when I first installed linux, I just hit the install button, and the installer did its magic. It was only later, I puzzled for quite some time over this matter, when trying to "properly" set up a fresh system, not just letting the installer do all the work.

  > 2. If the motherboard on your computer supports UEFI (Unified Extensile Firmware), you can choose GPT.
  > 3. If the motherboard uses legacy BIOS system, you should choose MBR. BIOS does not support GPT-partitioned volumes.
* [Explaining UEFI Firmware for Linux Users - LinuxBabe](https://www.linuxbabe.com/desktop-linux/legacy-bios-vs-uefi-bios)
  > You will see online that many people refer to it as UEFI BIOS. Strictly speaking, this is wrong, because BIOS is not a generic term for firmware. BIOS is a specific firmware for IBM compatible PC, so we should call the newer firmware UEFI.
* [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI)
  > The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) or its version 2.x variant, Unified EFI (UEFI) is a firmware type that is widespread on recent computers, especially those more recent than 2010. It is intended to replace the traditional BIOS firmware that is prevalent on earlier machines. This page provides information about installing and booting Ubuntu using UEFI, as well as about switching between UEFI mode and legacy BIOS mode using Ubuntu. Warning /!\ Most modern computers support both UEFI mode and BIOS mode.

  > The default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. By default, the configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can be edited to create local overrides.

### Accounts and Permissions

I was having a bit of trouble understanding how to properly set up and operate a user alongside and admin acct

I guess the idea is that the administrator account is the first created automatically (in ubuntu) then create a user account. Although the default administrator requires password for sudo, since 'root' is actually abstracted from the ui. Though not actually root, that administrator does, have generally elevated privs otherwise. So by making a user account, you have an additional layer of security, should some application get loose, it doesn't inherit any administrator privliges from you 

but......... to use sudo from the user account 

you must either su administrator or add the user account to your list of sudoers

and if you break sudo by messing up /etc/sudoers then you can use pkexec as an alternative to sudo to fix it
