Click Find New Keywords and then you're good to go!

We're going to enter 10 Seed Keywords, those are different ways someone might search for your business, or a business like it. If you don't get enough keyword ideas then leave the web-site blank.

Google comes up with keywords, based on your seed keywords. Ideally you want google to come up with a lot of them. We'll get to that later.

Go to the top right corner and download the keywords and keyword planner will give you a csv file that we're going to open up in a spreadsheet program.

You can see that there are a lot of ways to explore this data, I'm going to sort it by volume.

Then I can cut out all of the keywords that are really high volume or by whatever metrics I'm looking at, and use the keywords I get from keyword planner with a number of other tools.
