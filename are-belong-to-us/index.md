This blog is where I document my journey as an independent web-worker, and will grow to include contributions from other independent workers of the web.

This page has some samples of content that I've created for others, as well as general resources for web-work.

Originally it wasn't in blog form, but I've learned there are a number of reasons to use the blog format over individual pages. I just looked on github, and did my best to approximate when I first created a resource to see what date to use for the blog-post.
